# Tasks: Customer Support and Refund Service

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-support-refund-service/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification. Since the spec doesn't explicitly request TDD, tests are not included in this task list.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **[DDD]**: Tasks related to Domain-Driven Design implementation
- **[QA]**: Tasks related to quality assurance and testing
- **[Perf]**: Tasks related to performance optimization
- **[Sec]**: Tasks related to security implementation

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Domain layer**: `backend/src/domain/`
- **Application layer**: `backend/src/application/`
- **Infrastructure layer**: `backend/src/infrastructure/`
- **API endpoints**: `backend/src/api/`
- **Frontend components**: `frontend/src/app/` (React structure)
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/`
- Paths shown below assume web app structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (needs support cases to exist) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 (needs refund cases to exist) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1, US2, US3 (needs cases to display) but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Backend before frontend integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Frontend components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SupportCase domain model in backend/src/models/support_case.py"
Task: "Create SupportCase repository in backend/src/repositories/support_repository.py"

# Launch all frontend components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SupportCaseForm component in frontend/src/components/SupportCaseForm.tsx"
Task: "Create SupportCaseList component in frontend/src/components/SupportCaseList.tsx"
Task: "Create SupportCaseDetail component in frontend/src/components/SupportCaseDetail.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create RefundCase domain model in backend/src/models/refund_case.py"
Task: "Create RefundCase repository in backend/src/repositories/refund_repository.py"

# Launch all frontend components for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create RefundRequest component in frontend/src/components/RefundRequest.tsx"
Task: "Create RefundCaseList component in frontend/src/components/RefundCaseList.tsx"
Task: "Create RefundCaseDetail component in frontend/src/components/RefundCaseDetail.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2  
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 75
**Tasks per User Story**:
- User Story 1 (P1): 13 tasks
- User Story 2 (P2): 13 tasks  
- User Story 3 (P3): 13 tasks
- User Story 4 (P4): 9 tasks
**Setup Phase**: 8 tasks
**Foundational Phase**: 9 tasks
**Polish Phase**: 10 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- 24 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- All user stories can be developed in parallel after Foundational phase
- Frontend and backend components within each story can be developed in parallel

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Customer can create, view, and close support cases independently
- **US2**: Customer can request refunds from existing support cases with eligibility validation
- **US3**: Support agents can view, approve, and reject refund cases independently
- **US4**: Customers can view history of their support and refund cases independently

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (P1) - Basic support case functionality that provides immediate customer value and foundation for refund workflow.
