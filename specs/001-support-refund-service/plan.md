# Implementation Plan: Customer Support and Refund Service

**Branch**: `001-support-refund-service` | **Date**: 2026-01-04 | **Spec**: D:/Dev/Master/Furniture-Shop/specs/001-support-refund-service/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-support-refund-service/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements a comprehensive customer support and refund service for the furniture web shop. It enables customers to open support cases, request refunds for products within a 14-day window from delivery, and provides support agents with tools to process refund requests. The system includes overview pages for tracking case status and history, with proper validation, notifications, and data integrity controls.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12, TypeScript 5.4 (from constitution)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (backend), React 18 (frontend), SQLite, Redis (from constitution)  
**Storage**: SQLite for main data storage, Redis for caching and session management (from constitution)  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Jest (frontend), comprehensive unit/integration/e2e testing (from constitution)  
**Target Platform**: Web application with backend API and frontend UI  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load for overview pages, <500ms API response times, handle 100+ concurrent support agents  
**Constraints**: Domain-Driven Design patterns, Clean Architecture principles, RESTful API design  
**Scale/Scope**: Support for thousands of customers, orders, and cases with proper validation and data integrity

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with clear separation between backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React). Backend follows Clean Architecture with models, services, API endpoints, and repositories. Frontend organized by components, pages, services, and TypeScript types.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |

| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
