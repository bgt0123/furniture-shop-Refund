# Feature Specification: Customer Support and Refund Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-support-refund-service` 
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a customer support and refund service within the web shop for designer furniture. The service allows for support cases and refund cases based on orders and their products. Customers can open and close support cases and request refunds for products from an open support case. When a refund is requested, a refund case is created and linked to the support case. The customer support can approve and execute refund cases, if the refund is requested within 14 days after product arrived at the customer. Not all products of an order have to be refunded, if not requested by the customer. The service provides overview pages for support cases and refund cases showing their current status, customer, and history."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Customer Opens Support Case (Priority: P1)

Customers can create support cases for their orders when they have issues with products. They provide order details, select specific products, describe the issue, and optionally attach images or documents.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that enables all other support and refund operations. Without the ability to open support cases, customers cannot request refunds or get assistance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a customer creating a support case with valid order information and verifying the case appears in the system with correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** customer has placed an order, **When** they navigate to support section and select "Open Support Case", **Then** system displays form with order selection and product selection
2. **Given** customer selects an order and specific products, **When** they provide issue description and submit, **Then** support case is created with status "Open" and linked to selected order/products
3. **Given** customer has open support case, **When** they view their support cases, **Then** they see the new case with all provided details

### User Story 2 - Customer Requests Refund from Support Case (Priority: P2)

From an open support case, customers can request refunds for specific products. The system creates a refund case linked to the support case and validates eligibility based on the 14-day window from product delivery.

**Why this priority**: Refund functionality is core to customer satisfaction and legal compliance. This builds on the support case foundation and enables the refund workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a support case, requesting a refund for eligible products, and verifying the refund case is created with proper linkage and status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** customer has open support case, **When** they select "Request Refund" for specific products, **Then** system validates refund eligibility based on delivery date
2. **Given** products are eligible for refund (within 14 days), **When** customer confirms refund request, **Then** refund case is created with status "Pending" and linked to support case
3. **Given** products are not eligible (outside 14 days), **When** customer attempts refund, **Then** system shows clear error message explaining ineligibility

---

### User Story 3 - Support Agent Processes Refund Request (Priority: P3)

Support agents can view refund cases, review eligibility, and approve or reject refund requests. Approved refunds are executed and marked as completed.

**Why this priority**: This completes the refund workflow by enabling support agents to process requests, ensuring customers receive their refunds in a timely manner.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a refund case, having an agent approve it, and verifying the refund is processed and status updated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** support agent views refund case list, **When** they select a pending refund case, **Then** system shows full details including order, products, eligibility status
2. **Given** refund case is eligible and valid, **When** agent clicks "Approve", **Then** refund is processed and status changes to "Approved"
3. **Given** refund case has issues, **When** agent clicks "Reject", **Then** system prompts for rejection reason and updates status to "Rejected"

---

### User Story 4 - Customer Views Support and Refund History (Priority: P4)

Customers can view overview pages showing all their support cases and refund cases with current status, history, and details.

**Why this priority**: Transparency and self-service capabilities reduce support burden and improve customer satisfaction by providing visibility into their cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating various support and refund cases with different statuses and verifying the overview pages display them correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** customer navigates to support history, **When** page loads, **Then** they see list of all support cases with status, date, and brief description
2. **Given** customer selects a support case, **When** they view details, **Then** they see full history including all actions and status changes
3. **Given** customer navigates to refund history, **When** page loads, **Then** they see list of all refund cases with status, amount, and processing dates

### Edge Cases

- What happens when customer requests refund for products that are partially eligible (some within 14 days, some outside)?
- How does system handle support cases for orders with multiple shipping dates (products delivered at different times)?
- What happens when customer attempts to close a support case that has pending refund requests?
- How does system handle refund requests for products that have already been partially refunded?
- What happens when support agent tries to approve a refund that exceeds the original payment amount?
