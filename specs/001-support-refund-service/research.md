# Research Findings: Customer Support and Refund Service

## Domain Analysis

### Decision: Domain-Driven Design Approach
- **Rationale**: The feature involves complex business rules around support cases, refund eligibility, and status transitions. DDD provides the necessary patterns (Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services) to model this domain accurately.
- **Alternatives considered**: Simple CRUD approach, but this would scatter business rules across layers and make validation difficult.

### Decision: Clean Architecture with Layered Design
- **Rationale**: The constitution mandates Clean Architecture principles. This provides proper separation of concerns with Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers.
- **Alternatives considered**: MVC pattern, but Clean Architecture better supports testability and maintainability.

## Technical Stack

### Decision: Python 3.12 + FastAPI for Backend
- **Rationale**: Constitution specifies Python 3.12+ with FastAPI. FastAPI provides excellent support for RESTful APIs, type hints, and async capabilities.
- **Alternatives considered**: Django, Flask - but FastAPI better alignes with modern API development and performance requirements.

### Decision: React 18 + TypeScript for Frontend
- **Rationale**: Constitution specifies React 18+ with TypeScript. This provides strong typing, component-based architecture, and excellent ecosystem support.
- **Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular - but React is the standard for this codebase.

### Decision: SQLite for Data Storage
- **Rationale**: Constitution specifies SQLite. It's lightweight, file-based, and suitable for this scale of application.
- **Alternatives considered**: PostgreSQL, MySQL - but SQLite is sufficient for current requirements and simpler to deploy.

### Decision: Redis for Caching and Session Management
- **Rationale**: Constitution specifies Redis. It provides fast in-memory caching and session storage.
- **Alternatives considered**: Memcached - but Redis offers more features and persistence options.

## Business Logic and Validation

### Decision: 14-Day Refund Eligibility Window
- **Rationale**: Business requirement to comply with consumer protection regulations and maintain customer satisfaction.
- **Implementation**: Calculate from product delivery date, validate when refund request is made.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle partial eligibility (some products within window, some outside), multiple delivery dates.

### Decision: Support Case Status Management
- **Rationale**: Clear state transitions needed for business workflow: Open → Closed, with validation to prevent closing cases with pending refunds.
- **Implementation**: State machine pattern with explicit transitions and validation rules.

### Decision: Refund Case Status Management
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive workflow: Pending → Approved/Rejected → Completed.
- **Implementation**: State machine with validation at each transition point.

## Integration and Data Flow

### Decision: RESTful API Design
- **Rationale**: Constitution mandates RESTful API. Provides standard, predictable endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
- **Implementation**: Follow REST conventions with proper resource naming, HTTP methods, and status codes.

### Decision: Email Notification Service
- **Rationale**: Business requirement for customer communication. Need to integrate with existing email service.
- **Implementation**: Async notification service that sends emails for key events without blocking main workflow.

## Performance and Scalability

### Decision: Caching Strategy
- **Rationale**: Performance requirement for overview pages (<2s load time).
- **Implementation**: Cache frequently accessed case lists and details using Redis.

### Decision: Database Optimization
- **Rationale**: Performance requirement for handling concurrent operations.
- **Implementation**: Proper indexing on frequently queried fields (customer_id, status, dates).

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Testing Approach
- **Rationale**: Constitution requires ≥80% test coverage and comprehensive testing strategy.
- **Implementation**:
- Unit tests: Individual components and functions
- Integration tests: API endpoints and service interactions
- E2E tests: Complete user journeys
- Performance tests: Load testing for concurrent operations

### Decision: Test Data Strategy
- **Rationale**: Need realistic test data for validation scenarios.
- **Implementation**: Factory pattern for creating test entities with various statuses and dates.
